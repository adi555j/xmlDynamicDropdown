# xmlDynamicDropdown
create dropdown from data fetched from xml.

You can fetch data from xml and create drop down menues directly from it. You need to specify the xml attributes in the listOfAttributes array in the xml-html.js file. Everything else is preety much self-explanatory. I will cleanup this code further as soon as i will get time and more skills ;) .
