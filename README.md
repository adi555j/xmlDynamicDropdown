# xmlDynamicDropdown
create dropdown from data fetched from xml. Documentation is written in index.html file.

#You can fetch data from xml and create drop down menues directly from it. You need to specify the xml attributes in the listOfAttributes array in the xml-html.js file. Everything else is preety much self-explanatory. I will cleanup this code further as soon as i will get time and more skills ;) .

#Once the main node value changes the subsequent node values changes accordingly

#Submit button gets all the select values

# Future goals
Multiple levels of select with dependecies on each other

# Note:
If you are testing this in local environment use Firefox or IE. It will be best if you setup a local server and run this. :)
